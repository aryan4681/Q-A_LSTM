# Question Answering Model using LSTM

This Jupyter notebook demonstrates a question answering model using a simple LSTM model and an attention-based LSTM model.

## Overview

The notebook covers several key aspects:
- Downloading and preprocessing the dataset suitable for training a question answering model.
- Implementation of a Bi-directional LSTM for the encoder to capture context from both directions.
- Implementation of an attention-based LSTM model.
- Evaluation of the model using BLEU score, displaying both the predicted and true answers.
